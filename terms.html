                                <p><strong>Peer to Peer - Credit Transfer</strong></p>
                                <p>As part of your User Account you may transfer Careem Credits from your Account to the Account of another User. When transferring Careem Credit balance to another User, the amount transferred and the applicable Careem Fees (if any) will be deducted from your User account balance and will be transferred and added to the Careem Credit balance of the other User. Once the request for the transfer of Careem Credit is completed, the transfer cannot be cancelled or otherwise reversed. You agree that in providing you with this feature, Careem is merely enabling the transfer of Careem Credit balance. Careem is not responsible for the actions of the individual Users, including the reason for which Careem Credit is transferred by or to you</p>
                                <p><strong>Peer to Peer - Cash Transfers</strong></p>
                                <p>As part of your User Account, you may have access to ‘Cash Transfers’. Cash Transfers are subject to applicable law at all times and may not be permitted in some jurisdictions. Even where Cash Transfers are permitted and available they are restricted to Cash Transfers to other Users that are resident in the same jurisdiction as you and that hold a bank account in that same jurisdiction (“Recipient Users”).</p>
                                <p>Cash Transfers are intended to be used in the context of small ‘social payments’ i.e. repaying a friend for a meal out, the cost of a shared ride, a cinema ticket and so on. Cash Transfers are not intended to be used for own account transfers, avoiding charges for cash withdrawal, or artificially inflating benefits from credit/debit cards. You acknowledge and agree that Cash Transfers must not be used for any prohibited, fraudulent, illegal or improper purpose.</p>
                                <p>Cash Transfers by you to Recipient Users are subject to applicable law and limits in respect of the number, frequency and amounts of relevant transfers as well as the location of Recipient Users. Such limits are at the sole discretion of Careem and Careem may modify such limits from time to time without amending this Agreement. You will be notified if you have exceeded the limits and the Cash Transfer will be blocked and the amount refunded – requests will not be partially paid. Cash Transfers may not be permitted or available in your jurisdiction.</p>
                                <p>If we identify an unusual or potentially high risk Cash Transfer we may need to review it more closely before allowing it to go ahead. Cash Transfers which do not comply with these terms and conditions or are suspected to be in breach of relevant laws may be blocked, held, or refunded (as appropriate). This may mean that your Cash Transfer is delayed or may be rejected. In addition, we may suspend or restrict your use of CPay or your User Account as a whole if we suspect any: security issues in relation to your User Account; unauthorised or fraudulent use of the features made available to you through CPay ; or breach of these terms and conditions</p>
                                <p>Upon receiving a request in relation to a permissible Cash Transfer from you as transferor to a Recipient User as a transferee, Careem shall facilitate such transfer as a facilitator of social payments. The amount you elect to transfer will be deducted from your card on file by Careem subject to any charges incurred by your card issuing bank. The Recipient User you have identified will have the option, once notification of the transfer has been received by the Recipient User, to either receive the Cash Transfer as cash in a permissible bank account held in the name of the Recipient User or to receive Careem Credit in lieu of such cash amount.</p>
                                <p>If you are a Recipient User and elect to receive the Cash Transfer as cash in a permissible bank account held by you, you will be prompted to include the name of your bank, the name on your bank account and the IBAN number only. Careem will then facilitate the transfer of the relevant amount to such permissible bank account held by you. Careem will not ask for you to provide any financially sensitive information. You must only add the IBAN of your own, personal account. You must not add the details of a business account or an account of a third party. If, as a Recipient User, you do not accept the transferred amount within a certain number of days of receipt (and such number of days may vary from time to time), the relevant cash amount will be returned to the account of the transferor.</p>
                                <p>We will hold the amount corresponding with the Credit Transfer for as short a time as possible for the sole purpose of facilitating the Cash Transfer. We endeavor to credit the bank account of the Recipient User as soon as practically achievable after we receive the amount corresponding with the Credit Transfer. We are not responsible for the time it takes the bank of the Recipient User to credit the amount of the Cash Transfer your bank account and Careem shall not be liable in any way for the same and we reserve the right to decline any instruction to effect a Credit Transfer or when accepted, to complete a Credit Transfer.</p>
                                <p>You are responsible for the accuracy of the information you add or include on the Careem app. We may ask you for specific additional information that we believe to be necessary to give effect to our services to you. The provision of false or incomplete information or not providing information when asked may lead to the termination of your Careem profile and prosecution. All activities on the Careem app (including activities in connection with Credit Transfers) are regarded as activities by you and no other Users or persons and you shall not transact in connection with Credit Transfers for or on behalf of any other person. You acknowledge and agree that information about you, and the products we make available to you may be provided by us from time to time to regulatory, governmental authorities or other third parties in line with our privacy policy, where we are required by law, or we determine that such disclosure may help combat fraud, money laundering or other criminal activity.</p>
                                <p>You agree that, in relation to the above-mentioned cash transfer feature, Careem is acting only as a facilitator of social payments, is not responsible or liable for the actions of individual Users (including the reasons for the Cash Transfer) and that Careem does not operate a deposit-taking business in any manner nor is it otherwise presently licensed as a financial institution.</p>
                                <p>You agree to indemnify and hold Careem, its Affiliates, and other partners and their officers, directors, employees and agents harmless from any and all claims, demands, losses, liabilities, and expenses (including attorneys’ fees) arising out of or in connection with any improper or illegal use of CPay, your User Account, or the Cash Transfer product and/or any breach of these terms and conditions</p>

                                <p>By becoming a User you are part of the Careem Loyalty Program (the “Loyalty Program ”) in those markets where the Loyalty Program is available. Users will accrue points through using the Careem Platform to access Services provided by the third party service providers and may have access to a number of services, ways to support their local community, and benefits (“Rewards”) depending upon a given tier status (and relevant availability in any given market).</p>
                                <p>Users can earn or maintain tier status based on their usage of the Careem Platform in any calendar month. Once a User attains a tier level, it will remain in effect for 2 consecutive months. With respect to the expiry of points earned pursuant to the Loyalty Program, each calendar year consists of 2 reward periods: from January 1st to June 30th and from July 1st to December 31st (each a “Reward Period”) and any points earned in one Reward Period will expire automatically at the end of the following Reward Period.</p>
                                <p>Rewards are offered at the sole discretion of Careem and may be varied from time to time. Rewards and participating partners may differ from market to market and may be added or removed at the sole discretion of Careem. You may redeem points in exchange for Rewards or Donations (as applicable) at any time as indicated on the App. Where you redeem points Careem shall settle the equivalent or agreed amount (if applicable) with the participating partner and cancel its liability to you for the same. By redeeming Rewards you confirm that you agree to the terms of the Loyalty Program.</p>

                                <p>Careem may, among other things: (1) increase or decrease the number of points received for a given action or amount spent or the number of points required for a reward; (2) withdraw, limit, modify, or cancel any reward; (3) add blackout dates, limit availability for any reward, or otherwise restrict the continued availability of rewards; (4) change program benefits served by Rewards or its partners, conditions of participation, rules for earning, redeeming, retaining, or forfeiting points, or rules governing the use of rewards; (5) change or cancel rewards; and (6) change the rules governing the tier statuses, including but not limited to: rules to reach a tier status, duration and expiry rules of the tier status, benefits granted by reaching a given tier status.</p>
                                <p>Careem makes no warranties or representations, either expressed or implied, and expressly disclaim all liability (including consequential damages) with respect to type, timeliness, cost, quality or fitness of goods or services provided through the Loyalty Program.</p>
                                <p>If any participating Rewards partner improperly denies a User an accrual or benefit, the liability of Careem shall be limited to the equivalent value, in Rewards points, of that accrual or benefit as determined solely by Careem.</p>
                                <p>The Loyalty Program has no predetermined termination date and may continue until such time as Careem decides to terminate the Loyalty Program, at any time, with or without notice.

                                <p>Careem reserves the right to cancel a User’s access to the Loyalty Program and revoke any and all unredeemed Careem Rewards points collected by any Member who appears to be using the Loyalty Program in a manner inconsistent with the terms or intent of the Loyalty Program or any portion thereof. For reasons that include, but are not limited to: 1) violation of these terms and conditions; 2) misrepresentation of any information or any misuse of this Loyalty Program; 3) violation of any national, state or local law or regulation in connection with the use of this Loyalty Program; 4) commission of fraud or abuse involving any portion of this Loyalty Program ; or 5) action, in any other way, to the detriment of the Loyalty Program or any of its stakeholders; all as may be determined by Careem in its sole discretion.</p>

                                <p>Separate terms and conditions may apply to your reservation, purchase of goods and services, or rewards that you select. Please read these separate terms and conditions carefully. You agree to abide by the terms and conditions of purchase imposed by any supplier with whom you elect to deal.

                                <p><strong>Careem Plus Program</strong></p>

                                <p>The availability of Benefits is subject to all applicable local laws and regulations and are offered in good faith, however they may not be available and are subject to change if prohibited or restricted by applicable law or regulation.</p>
                                <p>Each Benefit may have additional terms or limitations. When redeeming Benefits made available by a Plus Partner, separate terms and conditions may apply to your purchase of goods and services from the Plus Partner. Please read these separate terms and conditions carefully. You agree to abide by the terms and conditions of purchase imposed by any Plus Partner you elect to deal with. You understand that any violation of any such Benefits Partner's rules and restrictions may result in your being denied access to the applicable product or services, in your forfeiting any monies paid for such product or service.</p>
                                <p>You may be given an option to enroll in the Plus Program through in-app messaging or other digital channels (“Offer”).

It is your responsibility to ensure that you have reviewed the Offer terms before you accept and purchase a Subscription.</p>
                                <p>When you buy a Subscription Plan, you will be charged the Subscription Charge for your first Billing Cycle on the date of purchase, which activates the Benefits identified in the Offer. Careem may elect to provide you with a free trial to the Plus Program or other promotional subscriptions in which case you will be charged the Subscription Charge at the end of the trial period. If you do not wish to be charged the Subscription Charge, you must cancel the trial or promotional subscription before the end of the trial or promotional subscription. Eligibility for a free trial or promotional subscription is determined by Careem at its sole discretion.</p>
                                <p>AUTOMATICALLY (AND WITHOUT PRIOR NOTICE TO THE EXTENT ALLOWED AT LAW), YOUR SUBSCRIPTION PLAN WILL RENEW AT THE BEGINNING OF EACH BILLING CYCLE, AND THE SUBSCRIPTION PRICE WILL BE AUTOMATICALLY CHARGED TO A PAYMENT METHOD AVAILABLE IN CPAY .

Any paid Subscription Charges are non-refundable and non-transferable.</p>
                                <p>Where VAT (or equivalent taxes) is in force when you buy a Subscription Plan, the Subscription Charges shall be inclusive of VAT. Where there is a future change in the VAT rate, Careem may at its discretion increase/decrease as applicable the Subscription Charge. Where VAT (or equivalent taxes) is not in force when you buy a Subscription Plan, the Subscription Charges shall be exclusive of VAT and if VAT (or equivalent) is later introduced, Careem may add the applicable VAT to the Subscription Charges.</p>
                                <p>You can cancel your Subscription Plan at any time prior to your next scheduled payment to avoid further charges and renewals. If you cancel your Subscription Plan, you will still have access to the Benefits until the end of the current Billing Cycle, and will not be refunded on a pro-rata basis for any cancellation initiated during a Billing Cycle. From time to time, Careem may increase the Subscription Charge in which case You will be notified before your next Billing Cycle. If you do not wish to be charged the new Subscription Charge, you are required to cancel your subscription.</p>
                                <p>Careem makes no warranties or representations, either expressed or implied, and expressly disclaim all liability (including consequential damages) with respect to the availability, accuracy, timeliness, cost, quality or fitness of goods or services provided through the Plus Program. Careem will also have no liability if any participating Plus Partner improperly denies you the right to avail of a Benefit.</p>
                                <p>The Plus Program has no predetermined termination date and may continue until such time as Careem decides to terminate the Plus Program or a specific Subscription Plan, at any time, with or without notice. If the Plus Program is terminated, Careem may refund you any unconsumed portion of your Subscription Charge without any further obligation or liability, including the availability of any Benefits after the conclusion of any notice period.</p>
                                <p>In addition, Careem reserves the right to modify the Plus Program, a Subscription Plan or any Benefit included in it, which changes will come into effect immediately, at your next Billing Cycle or at any other date determined by Careem.

Careem makes no warranties or representations, either expressed or implied in respect of any of the aforementioned methods of support , and expressly disclaims all liability (including consequential damages) with respect to timeliness, cost, quality or fitness of goods or services provided in relation to the same.</p>
                                <p>If the Participating Organisation that you designated in your listing ceases to be a participating charity or appropriately licensed entity before Careem pays the relevant Participating Organisation or if payment to that entity becomes impracticable, Careem may at its sole discretion choose to make payment to a Participating Organisation having a similar purpose without notifying you.</p>

This “Dispute Resolution” section applies to all Disputes (as defined below) between you and Careem and/or any of its Affiliates.</p>
                                <p><strong>Arbitration Process and Rules.</strong></p>
                                <p>Any dispute, conflict, claim or controversy arising out of or broadly in connection with or relating to the Careem Platform or this Agreement, including those relating to its validity, its construction or its enforceability (any “Dispute”) shall be first mandatorily submitted to mediation proceedings under the International Chamber of Commerce Mediation Rules (“ICC Mediation Rules”). If such Dispute has not been settled within sixty (60) days after a request for mediation has been submitted under such ICC Mediation Rules, such Dispute can be referred to and shall be exclusively and finally resolved by arbitration under the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce (“ICC Arbitration Rules”). The ICC Rules' Emergency Arbitrator provisions are excluded. The Dispute shall be resolved by one (1) arbitrator to be appointed in accordance with the ICC Rules. The place of both mediation and arbitration shall be in the city in which the applicable Affiliate with which you have a Dispute has its registered office. The language of the mediation and/or arbitration shall be English, unless you do not speak English, in which case the mediation and/or arbitration shall be conducted in both English and your native language. The existence and content of the mediation and arbitration proceedings, including documents and briefs submitted by the parties, correspondence from and to the International Chamber of Commerce, correspondence from the mediator, and correspondence, orders and awards issued by the sole arbitrator, shall remain strictly confidential and shall not be disclosed to any third party without the express written consent from the other party unless: (i) the disclosure to the third party is reasonably required in the context of conducting the mediation or arbitration proceedings; and (ii) the third party agrees unconditionally in writing to be bound by the confidentiality obligation stipulated herein.</p>

                                <p><strong>Choice of Law.</strong></p>
                                <p>This Agreement is governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction in which the relevant Affiliate is incorporated, without giving effect to any conflict of law principles, except as may be otherwise provided in supplemental terms applicable to your region.</p>
                                <p>Claims of Copyright Infringement.</p>
                                <p>Claims of copyright infringement should be sent to Careem at <a href="" class="link">legal@careem.com</a>.</p>
                                <p><strong>Notice.</strong></p>
                                <p>Careem may give notice by means of a general notice on the Careem Platform, electronic mail to your email address in your Account, or by written communication sent to your address as set forth in your Account. You may give notice to Careem by written communication to Careem's email address at <a href="" class="link">legal@careem.com.</a></p>
                                <p><strong>General.</strong></p>
                                <p>You may not assign or transfer your rights under this Agreement in whole or in part without Careem’s prior written approval. You give your approval to Careem for it to assign or transfer its rights and obligations under this Agreement in whole or in part, including to: (i) a subsidiary or affiliate; (ii) an acquirer of Careem’s equity, business or assets; or (iii) a successor by merger. No joint venture, partnership, employment or agency relationship exists between you, Careem or any Captain as a result of the contract between you and Careem or use of the Careem Platform.</p>
                                <p>If any provision of this Agreement is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, under any law, such provision or part thereof shall to that extent be deemed not to form part of this Agreement but the legality, validity and enforceability of the other provisions in this Agreement shall not be affected. In that event, the parties shall replace the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision or part thereof with a provision or part thereof that is legal, valid and enforceable and that has, to the greatest extent possible, a similar effect as the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision or part thereof, given the contents and purpose of this Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement and understanding of the parties with respect to its subject matter and replaces and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous agreements or undertakings regarding such subject matter.</p>
